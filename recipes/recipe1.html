            <p>“Made this tonight,” says Lisa Dilorenzo. “Was excellent. Will add to rotation during cold months. I did use hot Italian sausage and added Romano to the broth at the end for extra flavor.”</p>

            <p>“The trick here is to refrigerate after cooking and eat it the day after,” according to Rev. “The flavor was even better and more savory the second day.” </p>

            <p>“I have made this recipe for years now just as written,” says danielle. “Amazing!! Just recently I have substituted a head of cauliflower and one package of mushrooms for the potatoes. It is just as good!!” </p>
